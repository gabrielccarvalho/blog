## Quick background story

Me and some close friends were trying to get active in the gym, but we lacked
motivation to do it, so one of them suggested this one app that you can log
every time you went to the gym and rank us based on that.

It was a success, we were all hooked on it, I started to go to the gym more than
I've ever been. So it got me thinking what was different... The <span style={{ color: '#FFF' }}>dopamine</span>.

The same feeling that you get when you rank up on a game, we were getting by working out.

Soon my friends and I had the idea to add a challenge on this app, but this time to track our study time. So we can get
the same feeling, but studying. Altough it was a great idea, the whole app was
built for fitness pourposes... So it came the idea for <a href='https://study.app.br' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' style={{ color: '#FFF' }}>Study App</a>.

## Building the MVP

With the idea in mind and fully validated by my friends, I jumped over VS Code and started developing what would be the
first version of Study App.

### Tech choices

All of the choices were made in a way that I'd be able to deliver the MVP as fast as possible, with little to no waste
of time, so I went with the stack I'm most comfortable with.

To avoid speding too much time making a design system, I used the awesome lib called
<a href='https://ui.shadcn.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' style={{ color: '#FFF' }}>shadcn/ui</a>
to build the components.

For authentication and user management, I went with
<a href='https://clerk.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Clerk</a>
to handle the authentication without having to worry about it.

As my database, I went with Firebase
<a href='https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Firestore</a>
for a while, but soon changed to a postgres instance on Vercel, since I was using
Next and deploying on Vercel, it was a no brainer.

And lastly, for the images the users would upload, I simply used a S3 bucket from
<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/s3/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>AWS</a>.

### The design

That was a tough part. I was never very good designing great UI/UX interfaces by myself,
and when I did, it usually took me a lot of time to get it right.

So I had the idea to use the same design idea the original app were using and just
adding the features we needed, changing the stuff we didn't need and so on.

It didn't sound like a bad idea, since the only users would be me and my friends
and I wanted to deliver the first version as fast as possible. In the end,
<span style={{ color: '#FFF' }}>done is always better than perfet</span>.

## The learning curve

At some point in time, all of us developers think we know how to do everything, that is 'just a google search' and its done...
Well, if you didn't, I did thought like that, and soon enough I was proven very wrong.

So many things that were handled by my coworkers and I didn't had to worry about before, I was having to handle by myself,
without a team to back me up. It seems like a small thing, building an app for some friends, but in reality it was a huge
grow and an amazing experience in spite of it all.

Of course, the app crashed a lot of times on production, the design was not the best, the code wasn't nearly perfect, but
it was on and serving its purpose, and that was the best feeling I've had developing something.

## My takeaways

Some of the key things I've learned during this experience was:

- Done is always better than perfect.
- You don't know everythin.
- The best motivation is to see other people using your product.
- It's almost certain that the couple first projects you launch will fail, and that's okay.

In summary, quoting Nike: <span style={{ color: '#FFF' }}>Just do it</span>.
