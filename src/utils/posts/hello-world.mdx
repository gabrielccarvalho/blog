## Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'll start by introducing myself and what you should expect to find here...

I'm Gabriel, a software engineer from Brazil. In the moment I'm writing this I'm 23 years-old, with over 4 years working
with Typescript, React, React Native and Node.

## The Plan

I always saw very successful developers and builders keeping the habit of document their lifes over blog posts like this
and, full of hope, I started one myself.

I'm definetly not in the slightest a good writer, but <span style={{ color: '#FFF' }}>practice leads to perfection</span>, so
I'm hoping that by maintaining this habit I'll eventually look back and laugh about what I've written today.

## The Agreement

I made a deal to myself to write at least one article every 2 weeks. That's no need to rush anything or write nonsense just 
to keep up with the goal. I think that the 2-week-period is a good place to start from, maybe in the future I can short this
interval...

## The Content

I plan to write about meaningful experiences and quick access guides for problems that I stumble upon my journey of coding.

So you can expect here:
- Learn from my mistakes.
- Loads of code.
- Tutorials for something that maybe you are facing as well.

Hopefully this blog will document the my most valuable project: <span style={{ color: '#FFF' }}>My career</span>.

### See you soon in a couple weeks! ðŸ‘‹
